<h1>Configuring Scaffold</h1>
<p>We like to think Scaffold has some sensible options set for you out of the box, but there’s always going to be something you have to change. That’s why all of our config is in a sensible place.</p>
<p>Although you can use <a href="/classes/config">the <code>Config</code> class</a> to add, remove, and change system configuration items, you’re only allowed to do so after Scaffold has initialised for security reasons. Instead, we recommend changing items in the <code>/config</code> folder.</p>
<p>To see what configuration items you need to change, stop reading this and click something on the left instead.</p>
